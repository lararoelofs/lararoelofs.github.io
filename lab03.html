  <h3> What I do </h3>
  <p> I am very interested in <strong>sustainability and environemtnal issues</strong>. At Dartmouth, I study ecology and the environment. I also work in a cellular biology lab, researching moss cells, and in the Dartmouth Life Sciences Greenhouse. Outside of academics, I love to ski and climb. </p>
