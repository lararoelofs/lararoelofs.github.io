  <h1> About Me </h1>
  <h3> Who I am </h3>
  <p> My name is Lara Roelofs. I am from <em>Massachusetts</em>, and I grew up on the coast with my two siblings (I'm a middle child) and two dogs. I am a student at Dartmouth College, in the class of 2025. This is my first web page, for an assignment in GEOG 50.02, Web Mapping & Application. </p>
  <h3> What I do </h3>
  <p> I am very interested in <strong>sustainability and environemtnal issues</strong>. At Dartmouth, I study ecology and the environment. I also work in a cellular biology lab, researching moss cells. Outside of academics, I love to ski and climb. </p>
